#Introducing Carnap

Carnap is a free and open-source[^1] interactive proof-checker that runs in
any modern web-browser. It can display a proof's development in real time,
verify the correctness and contents of partial proofs, and  offer simple
explanations of errors.

Here are some interactive examples of what Carnap can do.

<div class="slider">
<div>
This is how you can prove Peirce's theorem:
```{#proof1 .proof .strict}
Show: ((P=>Q)=>P)=>P
    (P=>Q)=>P PR
    Show: P
        -P PR
        -(P=>Q) MT 2,4
        Show: P=>Q
            P PR
            Show: Q
                :ID 7,4
            :CD 8
        :ID 5,6
    :CD 3
```
To see some feedback on partial proofs and errors, change the proof above and
mouse over the proof analysis that appears to the right. To see a list of
available rules, press "?" while editing the proof. To see more examples of
what Carnap can do, press "next" below.
</div>
<div>
Carnap can handle proofs in first order logic. Here's a proof of Russell's theorem.

```{#proof2 .proof}
Show: -ExAy(R(x,y)<=>-R(y,y))
	ExAy(R(x,y)<=>-R(y,y)) PR
	Show P/\-P
		Ay(R(r,y)<=>-R(y,y)) PR
		R(r,r)<=>-R(r,r) UI 4
		Show: R(r,r)
			-R(r,r) PR
			-R(r,r)=>R(r,r) BC 5
			R(r,r) MP 7,8
			:ID 7,9
		R(r,r)=>-R(r,r) BC 5
		-R(r,r) MP 6,11
		Show: (P/\-P)
			:ID 6,12
		:ED 2,13
	P S 3
	-P S 3
	:ID 16,17
```
</div>
<div> 
Carnap can handle function symbols and equational reasoning. Here's a proof
of the fact that the bisectors of the sides of a triangle always meet at
a point (from the assumption that a point is on the bisector of a segment if
and only if it's equidistant from the endpoints of that segment).

```{#proof3 .proof}
AxAyAz(On(x,b(y,z))<> d(x,y) = d(x,z)) PR
Show AwAxAyAz(On(w,b(x,y))^On(w,b(x,z))=>On(w,b(y,z)))
    Show AxAyAz(On(a,b(x,y))^On(a,b(x,z))=>On(a,b(y,z)))
        Show AyAz(On(a,b(b,y))^On(a,b(b,z))=>On(a,b(y,z)))
            Show Az(On(a,b(b,c))^On(a,b(b,z))=>On(a,b(c,z)))
                Show On(a,b(b,c))^On(a,b(b,d))=>On(a,b(c,d))
                    On(a,b(b,c))^On(a,b(b,d)) PR
                    On(a,b(b,c)) S 7
                    On(a,b(b,d)) S 7
                    AyAz(On(a,b(y,z))<> d(a,y) = d(a,z)) UI 1
                    Az(On(a,b(b,z))<> d(a,b) = d(a,z)) UI 10
                    On(a,b(b,c))<> d(a,b) = d(a,c) UI 11
                    On(a,b(b,d))<> d(a,b) = d(a,d) UI 11
                    On(a,b(b,c)) > d(a,b) = d(a,c) BC 12
                    On(a,b(b,d)) > d(a,b) = d(a,d) BC 13
                    d(a,b) = d(a,c) MP 8 14
                    d(a,b) = d(a,d) MP 9 15
                    d(a,c) = d(a,d) LL 16 17
                    Az(On(a,b(c,z))<> d(a,c) = d(a,z)) UI 10
                    On(a,b(c,d))<> d(a,c) = d(a,d) UI 19
                    d(a,c) = d(a,d) > On(a,b(c,d)) BC 20
                    On(a,b(c,d)) MP 18 21
                    :CD 22
                :UD 6
            :UD 5
        :UD 4
    :UD 3
```
</div>
<div>
The way that Carnap parses its input is configurable. So, one can enter proofs
in either a Kalish-and-Montegue-like format:

```{#proof4 .proof}
Show P=>(Q=>P)
    P PR
    Show Q=>P
        Q PR
        :CD 2
    :CD 3
```

or a Fitch-like format:

```{#proof5 .proof  .fitch}
    P AS
        Q AS
        P RP 1
    Q->P CD 2-3
P->(Q->P) CD 1-4
```

(depending on your preference, or the style of textbook you're working with).
</div>
<div>
You can also configure how formulas are parsed. So far, there's a lax mode, 
which allows you to use any string you like as a proposition or relation symbol:

```{#proof6 .proof}
Ax(Man(x)=>Mortal(x)) PR
Man(Socrates) PR
Man(Socrates) => Mortal(Socrates) UI 1
Mortal(Socrates) MP 2,3
```

And a strict mode, which permits a more compact "parentheses optional" syntax:

```{#proof7 .proof .strict}
Ax(Px=>Qx) PR
Ps PR
Ps => Qs UI 1
Qs MP 2,3
```

more parsers (e.g. for controlled fragments of English and whitespace agnostic input formats) are underway.
</div>
</div>

Carnap's core algorithms are language agnostic and highly extensible, so this
is just the beginning.

[^1]: Carnap is released under the GNU General Public Licence, and is also
    available without charge to anyone who would like to use it.

##What is it for?

Carnap is intended for use by teachers and students of logic. Carnap makes it
possible for students to get quick feedback on their work, and for educators
to rapidly prepare readings with embedded exercises, without the use of
proprietary software.

##Why "Carnap"?

Carnap is named after [Rudolf Carnap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Carnap), the philosopher quoted above. 

Carnap (the philosopher) famously advocated a tolerant and experimental
approach to logic. Carnap (the program) is pluralistic by design. Inference
rules are specified declaratively,[^2] making it easy to add new logics to those
already provided for a given language. The algorithms for checking whether
inferences are correct are applicable to a wide variety of languages,
making it easy to introduce new languages. 

Carnap (the philosopher) also had a lot to say about logical types, and how
ignoring them can leave you with beliefs that don't work very well.[^3]
Carnap (the program) is written in Haskell, a statically-typed functional
programming language that uses a theory of logical types to ensure code
correctness.

[^2]: What does this mean? Well, rather than writing code that explains *how* to
check whether an inference is an instance of a particular rule, you just say
what the rule *is*, by expressing it as a scheme. You can see some examples of
rule-declarations for propositional logic 
[here](https://github.com/gleachkr/Carnap/blob/master/Calculi/ClassicalSententialLogic1.hs).

[^3]: See, for example [@Anonymous:yTMf3RXg].

#Usage

There are lots of ways to use Carnap, but right now, the options below are the
best developed. You can find downloads and detailed set-up instructions on our
[github page](https://github.com/gleachkr/Carnap).

##With Pandoc

Carnap can be used to insert interactive proofs into a document written in
Pandoc markdown and translated into html. That's how this page was
created.[^4]

[^4]: The markdown source code for this page is available [here](index.pandoc).

##Webapps

Carnap can be embedded into webapps. One simple example is the application
available
[here](./Frontend/Ghcjs/Implementations/AllTheTautologies/dist/build/AllTheTautologies/AllTheTautologies.jsexe/index.html),
which generates an infinite list of tautologies that can be used to practice
derivations in propositional logic. Another simple example, available
[here](./Frontend/Ghcjs/Implementations/ShowThis/dist/build/ShowThis/ShowThis.jsexe/index.html)
, allows you to create a sharable list of problems in first-order logic, by
entering premises and conclusions; Carnap will check to see if you can
correctly derive the premises from the conclusions. 

##Slides

Carnap is compatible with several frameworks for HTML presentations. So, you
can embed interactive proofs into the slides that you use for lectures or
presentations. A simple example---also generated using Pandoc[^5]---can be found [here](./slides.html)

[^5]: The source code for the example slides is available [here](./slides.pandoc).

#Development

Carnap is currently at version 0.1.0, and is under active development. 

##Languages and Logics

In the near future, we hope to extend Carnap to cover a wider range of
languages, logics, and types of proof system, including modal and temporal
logic, languages with definite descriptions, and higher-order languages.

##Interface

We'd like to broaden the range of available interfaces. New webapps and
a command-line interface for batch-processing of proofs are on the way.
